# Sentiment-Analysis-of-IMDB-Movie-Reviews

The process of computationally identifying and classifying opinions found in written content, specifically to determine whether the author has a positive or negative viewpoint on a certain subject, item, etc.

The process of analysing a text to ascertain its sentiment is known as sentiment analysis. This is achieved by fusing deep learning with natural language processing (NLP).

Example
You may use sentiment analysis to analyse client feedback. For instance, you can apply sentiment analysis algorithms to text snippets like these after gathering feedback from multiple sources like Twitter and Facebook to determine how your consumers feel about your product.

We'll go over the processes of building a model that can do sentiment analysis on a large movie database since movie review analysis is a sort of customer feedback analysis in this context. The Internet Movie Database was used to compile the data (IMDb).
